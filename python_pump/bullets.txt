Introduction:
- AI-powered workout generator using Python and Flask.
- Generates custom workouts based on user input.
- Uses Matplotlib and NumPy for realistic progress visualization.
  
Core Functionality:
- Collects user data (weight, goal, difficulty, frequency, etc.).
- Generates three unique workout plans.
- Predicts fitness progress over six months.
- Creates a visual graph to track estimated changes.
  
Project Files:
- `project.py`: Main application handling user input, workout generation, progress prediction, and Flask routes.
- `templates/index.html`: Home page with a form to collect user data.
- `templates/workout_results.html`: Displays three workout plans.
- `templates/progress.html`: Displays the generated progress graph.
- `static/css/styles.css`: Provides styling and responsiveness.
- `test_project.py`: Contains Pytest test cases for core functions.
  
Design Choices:
- Flask Web Interface:** Enables interactivity and ease of navigation.
- Logarithmic Progression Model:** More realistic than linear growth models.
- Multiple Workout Plans:** Adds variety to keep users engaged.
- Graph Visualization:** Helps users stay motivated by tracking estimated improvements.
- CSS Enhancements:** Dark mode, animations, and mobile responsiveness.
  
Future Improvements:
- Implement user authentication for saving progress.
- AI-powered alternative exercises based on feedback.
- Integration with smartwatches and fitness apps.
- Personalized dietary recommendations.
  
Conclusion:
- Python Pump is a dynamic and intelligent fitness application.
- Combines AI, Flask, and data visualization to deliver a personalized fitness experience.
- A valuable tool for tracking and improving fitness goals over time.
- Encourages users to take control of their health in an engaging way.
